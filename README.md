## Day 1: Project Setup and Initial API Development

### Set Up the Project
- Create a new ASP.NET Core API project using Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
- Configure the project structure and necessary dependencies (e.g., Entity Framework, Serilog for logging).

### Set Up Database with Entity Framework
- Install and configure Entity Framework Core.
- Create your data models (Entities) and context class.
- Run migrations to set up the initial database schema.

### Implement Core Endpoints
- Scaffold basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for your main entity or resource.
- Ensure that at least the essential endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) are functional.
- Test these endpoints using Swagger or Postman.

## Day 2: Enhancing API Functionality and Security

### Implement Core Business Logic
- Add any necessary business logic in the service layer.
- Refactor code to use Data Transfer Objects (DTOs) to decouple the API from the data model.

### Implement Basic Authentication
- Set up user authentication using JWT (JSON Web Tokens).
- Protect the API endpoints with role-based authorization.

### Improve API Security
- Configure CORS to allow or restrict API access from certain domains.
- Secure sensitive endpoints, ensuring they require valid authentication tokens.

### Logging and Error Handling
- Set up logging with Serilog to track requests and errors.
- Implement global error handling to manage exceptions across the API.

## Day 3: Finalizing and Testing

### Optimize and Review
- Refactor the code to ensure clarity, efficiency, and maintainability.
- Implement the Repository pattern if possible to separate data access logic.

### Testing
- Perform comprehensive testing of all API endpoints (using Postman or Swagger).
- Test authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- Ensure that error handling works as expected and returns appropriate HTTP status codes.

### Documentation and Deployment
- Document the API endpoints and their usage (using Swagger or manually).
- If required, deploy the API to a local or cloud environment.
- Ensure your code is pushed to a version control system like GitHub.

### Prepare for Handoff
- Prepare a short summary of the work you have done, including instructions for setting up, running, and extending the API.
- Be ready to present or discuss the functionality, challenges, and decisions made during development.
